## Introduction




The Projection Upsampling Network (PU-Net) is a deep learning-based architecture inspired by the 3D U-Net framework, designed to reconstruct structured illumination microscopy (SIM) images from noisy, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) input data. In SIM, raw data typically comprise multiple images captured under varying illumination patterns. For instance, a two-beam SIM system may produce nine images (three angles × three phases), while a three-beam system can generate fifteen images (five angles × three phases).​


In our approach, these multi-channel SIM inputs are treated as a volumetric stack along the z-axis, effectively capturing the spatial and temporal variations inherent in the data. This representation enables PU-Net to learn the intricate spatiotemporal features necessary for accurate SIM reconstruction. By leveraging this strategy, PUNet effectively reconstructs high-fidelity SIM images from noisy, low-SNR datasets, offering a robust solution for enhancing image quality in challenging imaging conditions.​
